## What it can do for the moment

- It prints the tokens of the input, e.g print(25), shows 25, print("Hello World"), shows Hello World.
- Declare vars like, let x = 25 in print(x) shows 25. let x = "Hello World" in print(x) shows Hello World. let Ez = 1 in print("Cute kitty") shows Cute kitty.
- Multi vars allowed too. -> let x = 25, y = 25 in print(x + y) shows 50.
  - This is equivalent, so it's allowed too let number = 42, text = "The meaning of life is " in let x = number * 2 in print(text @ x);
- It can do operations like, let x = 25 in print(x + 25) shows 50. let x = 25 in print(x - 25) shows 0. let x = 25 in print(x * 25) shows 625. let x = 25 in print(x / 25) shows 1, let x = 25 in print(x ^ 25) shows 8.881784197001253E+34 xd.
  - Multi math_ops allowed too. -> let crazymath = ((2 - 18 * 2) + (2 / 10)) in print(crazymath ^ 2);
- Concat vars like, let x = "Hello", y = 2023 in print(x @ y) shows Hello2023.
  - If you try things like let x = 5, y = 6 in print(x @ y); it will sum the vars and then concat them, so it will show 11.
  - WTF is this -> let number = 42, z = 4 in let x = number * 2 in let y = 3 in print((z + x) ^ y); Also works. Strings works surpresingly well.
  - This is even worst let x = 5, y = x + 12 in let z = x + y in print((x + y + z) ^(let uper = 5 in uper - 3)); And it works too. Don't ask me why.
- Also, you can declare functions like `function read_line(x)`, and it will recognize the function, function name and parameters, but it won't do a shit.
- Conditions are also processed, but they just, don't work. That was 2 month ago, now they work ðŸ˜ˆ
- #conditions_were_a_fvcking_nightmare!
  - let x = 5 in if ((let y = 2 in y*y) < 5) print("Voila") else print("f"); -> shows Voila.
  - if (42 % 2 == 60 - 60) print("Yes") else print("F"); shows -> Yes, I mean literally prints yes
