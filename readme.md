# Tester Description

This tester is a tool designed to validate and ensure the correctness of our software. It works by running a series of automated tests on the codebase, checking for any errors or unexpected behavior.

Key Features:
- **Automated Testing**: The tester can run a series of tests automatically, saving time and effort.
- **Wide Coverage**: It is designed to cover as many aspects of the software as possible, from individual functions to integrated components.
- **Error Reporting**: If a test fails, the tester provides detailed error reports, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
- **Continuous Integration**: The tester can be integrated into the development process, allowing for continuous testing and early detection of issues.

Usage:
To use the tester, simply run the command `run_tests` in your terminal. The tester will then execute all tests and provide a summary of the results.
